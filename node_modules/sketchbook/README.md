# ðŸ“’ Sketchbook

Simple web based game engine built on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) focused on third-person character controls and related gameplay mechanics.

Mostly a playground for exploring how conventional third person gameplay mechanics found in modern games work and recreating them in a general way.

## Features

* World
    * Three.js scene
    * Cannon.js physics
    * Variable timescale
    * Frame skipping
    * FXAA anti-aliasing
* Characters
    * Third-person camera
    * Raycast character controller with capsule collisions
    * General state system
    * Character AI
* Vehicles
    * Cars
    * Airplanes
    * Helicopters

All planned features can be found in the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/swift502/Sketchbook/projects).
