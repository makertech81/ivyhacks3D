  This is a collection of reusable regular expressions.
  
  ## Why?
  
  Primarily because I can never remember which way a linebreak regular

  that simple one, how am I meant to remember anything more complicated.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Simply include the particular file you need for the regular expression
  you require:
